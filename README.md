# Hello friends < >

Iâ€™m learning and exploring the field of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.  
My main focus is on understanding systems, networks, and how to test their security through pentesting.  

I prefer to learn quietly, experiment practically, and improve step by step.  
Most of the projects and notes here are part of my personal learning journey.

Stay curious. Keep learning.
